"""Per-name compare of two goport test results (goport-tests.sh results.json). Read only.

usage: compare-tests.py <base results.json> <new results.json> [--name-map TSV] [--out FILE]

A results file that ends in .gz is read as gzip. Its
sha256 in the output is the sha256 of the file as stored. Each file must have a "pin" of 7 to 64 hex
characters (the Go pin that goport-tests.sh ran at), or the tool exits 2.

Every base name with status "ok" is protected. For each one, in its base suite:
  retained   ok in new
  lost       failed or ignored in new
  unrun      "unrun" in new, or missing from a new suite that is missing or incomplete
  absent     missing from a complete new suite
A base name that is not ok and is ok in new is recovered. A new name is one that no base name maps to.

--name-map TSV: one line per moved, renamed or removed test,
`<old suite>\t<old name>\t<new suite>\t<new name>\t<evidence>` (more tab cells belong to the evidence,
which must not be empty). "-" as the new suite and name means the test was removed; it is reported as
removedByMap and does not block. Blank lines, lines that start with # and a first line whose first cell
is "oldSuite" (a header) are skipped. Two base names may not map to one new name (exit 2). A map line
that is not an identity is rejected (mapRejected, exit 1) when:
  - its old name is still in the new results (a moved or removed test leaves no copy behind), except a
    removal line of a go_baselines_reference name that is "ignored" in go_baselines_reference of the new
    results: a stale Go reference file that no Go test at the new pin writes, which the reference walk
    lists as ignored (bump C reviewer ruling 1 item 5). Such lines are counted on their own in
    mapRemovedIgnored, and the reviewer checks the Go evidence of each. A removal line of a name that is
    ok or failed in the new results, or of an ignored name of another suite (a libtest #[ignore]), is
    rejected,
  - its new name is a base name (so a map cannot swap a lost name for a passing one, or chain), or
  - it removes a name, the Go pin did not change and the suite is not a kept-crate suite.
The reviewer checks each entry against its evidence.

Output: JSON with "base", "new" and "nameMap" (path, sha256), then per suite and in "total":
  retained, recovered, newNames: counts
  lost, absent, unrun: lists (in "total" each entry is "<suite>: <name>")
  removedByMap: base ok names that the map removes; list per suite, count in total
  recoveredNames, newFailed: lists per suite (newFailed: new names that fail), counts in total
and "mapRejected" ("line <n>: <reason>"), "mapRemovedIgnored" ("<suite>: <name>" of the removal lines
above), "mapUnused" (map lines whose old name is not in base) and
"verdict" (PASS or FAIL). With --out the JSON goes to FILE and stdout gets one summary line. Exit 1 when
any protected name is lost, absent or unrun or a map line is rejected; exit 2 on bad input.
