# Keeps the legacy /tmp/port tools alive. /tmp is tmpfs on Linux: a reboot empties it, and
# systemd-tmpfiles-clean deletes files there after 10 days. Old saved records pin /tmp/port/fp.py,
# compat/p5-corpus and typesyms/scale call /tmp/port/treehash.py, the oracle sweeps write their build
# info under /tmp/port, and scripts/upstream/rerecord.sh (sweep step) runs `restore` first.
#
# usage: tmp-port.sh save      copy /tmp/port into target/tmp-port-persist (run after a /tmp/port change)
#        tmp-port.sh restore   put back missing files in /tmp/port (never replaces a file)
#        tmp-port.sh check     exit 1 when a pinned file is missing or differs
# ~/.config/user-tmpfiles.d/ts-rust.conf runs the same restore at login.
# Put new tools in scripts/, never in /tmp.
