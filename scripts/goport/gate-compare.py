"""Compares two gate manifests item by item: the base (last accepted revision) and a candidate.

usage: scripts/goport/gate-compare.py <base manifest.json> <new manifest.json> [--state FILE] [--out FILE]

Rules (the gate manifest of each run).
- Every base id must be in the new run. A removed id is a regression.
- A base MATCH item must be MATCH, or ALLOWED by an allow entry (same id, condition and case path) that
  the base manifest's allow list has too ("reallowed"). The single-threaded-equal entries exist because the
  oracle's trace order changes with threads, so those items change between MATCH and ALLOWED on the same bins
  (corpus-diag/04640: r130-full ALLOWED, r131-full MATCH, r131-full-2 ALLOWED, the last two on one bins
  dir). MATCH to ALLOWED by an entry the base did not have is a regression.
- An ALLOWED item in the new run must carry allowedBy: the gate verified its gate-allow.txt
  condition again in this run.
- Case paths of allow entries. A corpus id names another case at another Go pin, so an allow entry of a
  CASE_PATH family (corpus-diag, corpus-emit, f1) names its case path (gate-allow.txt "<id> | <case path> |
  <condition> | <reason>"), and gate.sh applies it only to the item of that id with that case path. The
  case path of an entry is its path; an entry of the old form (gate.sh before case paths, which applied it
  by id only) has the case path of the item of its id in that run, the one case it could allow there, and
  none when that run has no such item. An ALLOWED item of such a family whose allowedBy entry names another
  case path, or none, is a regression. An entry of such a family without a case path gives no allowance.
- A FAIL in the new run is a regression, except an item of an open defect below.
- A new id is listed. A new id that is FAIL is a regression.

Open defect editor-long-growth (items editor/<project>/long). A FAIL passes only when
- the batch in --state (optional, no default) has an openDefects record
  with that id and a status that starts with "open",
- the new failure is growth only (no rss, no answers), and
- the Rust growth is at most the fixed cap of that project in LONG_CAP below (no ratchet on the base
  value). LONG_CAP is the one place of the caps; the compiler gate runs this
  file, and the output lists them in longCaps. Each cap is the highest Rust growth of a good build in the
  R126 to R131 and bump B gates + 0.15 MiB/edit: query-core 1.43 + 0.15 = 1.58, hono 1.13 + 0.15 = 1.28.
  The gate's own limit follows Go's slope, so the same bins can be MATCH or FAIL (editor/hono/long on
  b2b7dca1f: MATCH in r131-full at limit 1.88, FAIL in r131-full-2 at limit 1.00, both 1.13 MiB/edit).
  A project without a cap has no allowance: its FAIL is a regression.

How a cap is lowered (caps only go down; only the repo owner can raise one):
- By hand: a change that lowers the growth of a project (a fix) can lower its LONG_CAP value to that
  growth + 0.15. This file is a protected path, so the change lists it in allowedChangedFiles, and the
  reviewer checks the value against the gate runs. The new value applies from the next revision.
- By itself: the gate's normal limit (2 x Go + 1 MiB/edit, ls_edit_bench.py) is never under
  NORMAL_LIMIT (1.00, at Go growth 0), so a Rust growth at or under 1.00 passes it in every run. When the
  base gate's Rust growth of a project is at or under 1.00, the cap of that project is 1.00 in this
  compare: its item must be MATCH, and its Rust growth must stay at or under 1.00. Each accepted
  revision then keeps the cap lowered for the next one. A MATCH at a higher growth (a steep Go slope)
  does not lower the cap, because the next run of the same bins can FAIL.
The base growth comes from a growth FAIL detail, or else from the base gate's runs/editor/result.json
(for a MATCH item). When it is unknown, a FAIL is a regression. When every project's cap is 1.00, root
closes the openDefects record, and from then on every FAIL is a regression.

Tools. The manifest records the sha256 of every tool that judges the items: oracle, goDumper, gate,
allowList, each stage script (scripts; most of them live under target/, which no protected path covers)
and the cached Go outputs (oracleCaches). Each hash must equal the base run's hash. A changed or removed
tool is a regression unless the batch in --state lists that exact change in gateToolChanges:
{"key": "<key as in toolChanges>", "from": "<base sha256>", "to": "<new sha256>", "reason": "..."}; the
reviewer judges each listed change. A tool that the base run did not record is listed in newTools only.

Id map (pin bumps). A new Go pin can renumber the corpus cases, so the same case has another id in the
new run (corpus-diag/04640 at 52168999f3dc is corpus-diag/04704 at 16c25522e123). The batch in --state
can name a map in gateIdMap {"path": "<TSV, relative to the repo root or absolute>", "sha256": "..."}.
The file must have that sha256. It is used only when both manifests record an upstreamPin and the pins
differ; at one pin it has no effect (idMap.applied false), so it cannot move an id.
'#' lines, blank lines and the header line "oldId TAB newId TAB source" are skipped. Each other line is
"<old id> TAB <new id> TAB <case path>": the case moved to a new id. A line "<old id> TAB - TAB <case path>
TAB <note>" removes a case that Go removed (the removal check below); the note names the Go commit that deletes
the case file (a word of 7 to 40 hex digits; bump C reviewer ruling 2 item 3). Without such a line, a base case
that the new run does not hold is a removed id, also when Go removed it.
Only the corpus families (MAP_FAMILIES) can have lines, and both ids of a line are in one family (the part
before the first '/'). The case path of a corpus item is the source word at its fixed place in the
detail: "<class> <case path>" (corpus-diag, and f1) and "<class> exit <go>/<goport> <case path>"
(corpus-emit); notes can follow it. Bad input (exit 2): a line of another form (also "-" as the old id or the
case path, a move line with a note, and a removal line without a note that names a commit), and two lines with
one old id, one new id, or one case path in one family.
When the map is used:
- A base id with a line is compared with the new item of its new id: the same item under another id.
- The line's case path must equal the case path of the base item and of the new item. Else the line is
  broken and its base id is a removed id, so a map cannot pair two different cases. Layout move: when the
  new pin has the layout "typescript" (microsoft/TypeScript, tsc/), the new item's case path is the line's
  case path moved as below (an old _submodules/TypeScript/tests/cases path is under testdata/tests/cases),
  and a base allow entry that moves with its case has its case path moved the same way.
- A family with a line is a mapped family. A base id of a mapped family without a working line is a
  removed id, never compared with the new item of the same id (that id can be another case now).
  The ids of the other families are compared as before.
- A base allow entry moves only with its own case: an entry whose id is a base item that a working
  line moves applies to the new id of that line, with its own case path. Any other entry of a mapped
  family (an old pin's id, a case without a line or a glob) gives no allowance.
- A line whose old id is not a base id is unused (listed in idMap.unused).
- Removal check (Go at both pins). A removal line removes its base id (listed in idMap.removed, not a
  regression) only when its case path is the case path of the base item, the case file is in the base pin's
  Go checkout, the new pin's Go checkout has neither that path nor its moved path, and no new item of the
  family has either path. The Go checkouts and layouts come from `scripts/upstream/pin.py show <pin>` of this
  checkout. The moved path: at a new pin of layout "typescript" (microsoft/TypeScript, tsc/) an old
  _submodules/TypeScript/tests/cases/<p> is testdata/tests/cases/<p>, or the new name that the pin's
  testdata/promotedTestCollisions.txt gives. A removal line that fails the check is broken, and its base id is a
  removed id.
The output has idMap {path, sha256, lines, applied, mapped, broken, unused} only when the batch
names a map, so the output without a map stays the same. A map with removal lines adds idMap.removed
[{id, path, note}] (the removed ids, a count of their own; a removed id is never a pass for another id).

Prints one JSON object, and writes it to --out when given. Exit 0: no regression.
Exit 1: regressions. Exit 2: bad input.
