//! Rust-only: the owner and liveness of freeable file versions (lsshells
//! M3a, M3b, M3c).
//!
//! Go frees an `*ast.SourceFile` when no program and no parse cache entry
//! holds it (project/snapshot.go:537 `dispose`: `parseCache.Deref` for each
//! file of a released program). Here a static published file store is
//! leaked (`ast/store.rs`), so its id stays readable. A `FileVersion` gives
//! a file version the Go lifetime:
//! - its parse holds it (`ParsedSourceFile::version`), so each frontend
//!   program (`NewProgram`) and each parse cache entry that has the parse
//!   holds it;
//! - the tables of each program version that has the file hold it
//!   (`program::VersionTables`), so a checker, bind, emit or search thread
//!   that was seeded from that version holds it too (`WorkerSeed`);
//! - a thread that reads it pins it (`with_file_version`, `PINS`) until the
//!   next program release, or the next release of a source file lease that
//!   held the last parse holder (`release_file_version_pins`), or its end;
//! - a `FileRef` guard holds it while the guard lives;
//! - the registry here keeps only a `Weak`.
//!
//! M3b: at publish the version takes its `FileStore` and its `GoFile`
//! (info, `node_bind`, `file_bind`, `flow_nodes`)
//! (`ast::store::VersionStore`). Its node records and kids are in its node
//! shell, the registry block of its id, so the header and child reads stay
//! inline (`ast::store::node_shell`); its foreign parents are leaked there,
//! and the child link column is dropped. AST node records, step 4: the
//! records and kids are in a pooled block that the version gives back when
//! it dies; after two more pin releases (`pin_epoch`: program releases, and
//! lease releases that free a parse) a later node shell can take it
//! (`ast::store::BlockPool`).
//! M3c (owned nodes; on by default in a language server or API process,
//! see `owned_nodes_enabled`): its parse was a freeable parse
//! (`ast::enter_freeable_parse`), so its store owns its astdata nodes (node
//! structs and data boxes), its
//! pending lists and its parse lists (`ast::store::OwnedAst`), and they go
//! with the version. The node shell has no node column: a node data read
//! of the file is a scoped read of the pinned version
//! (`ast::with_scoped_store_node`), and a list of its node data is a handle
//! (`ast::StoreList`) that is read at each use.
//! M3d: the binder lineage binds the version into symbol and table chunks
//! of its own. After the version dies, the next bind frees them
//! (`program::Lineage`), and each program copy of the lineage lets go of
//! them when its release frees its tables (M2c, `program::bound_symbols`).
//! When the last holder lets go, the version is dead: its id goes to
//! `DEAD_FILES` and leaves the registry, its store and `GoFile` are freed
//! (after it, on a free thread, when a pin release of the stdio API or
//! `tsc -b -w` takes its data: `take_data`), and each per-file thread-local
//! map (`PerFileMap`) forgets the entries of that id when it is next
//! written. A later read of its store, `GoFile` or node data panics
//! with "file version N is released": ids are never reused, so a missed
//! holder panics there and never reads another file. A header or child
//! read of its node shell reads its pooled block: the data of that node
//! until another version takes the block, then that version's data. With
//! debug assertions that read panics with the same message (the owner
//! check, `ast::store::file_block`). A release build checks the owner only
//! in the binder field reads (`check_block_owner`), so there a stale
//! header or child read gives wrong data and no panic. The check in every
//! `file_block` read (one load, compare and branch) costs too much for a
//! release build (watchfix1 item 5, instructions:u of stable builds):
//! `goport -p --singleThreaded` query +7.9%, hono +7.9%, zod +7.1%, effect
//! +10.2% (+6.7% to +9.7% on the default threads), and the editor long
//! sessions query-core +9.6%, hono +4.5%, effect +9.3%. A correct reader
//! never sees a reuse: every holder of a node holds its version, and a
//! given-back block waits two pin releases (`BlockPool`). No standing run
//! has debug assertions: the protected tests run `--release`
//! (`build-goport-tests.sh`), and the corpus, editor and oracle runs use
//! release bins. A debug test build checks each `file_block` read.
//!
//! Freeable rule (`free_file_versions`, `freeable_path`): only a parse of
//! a path that a publish on this thread published before, in a language
//! server or API process (the parse cache, project/parsecache.rs) or a
//! `tsc --watch` or `tsc -b --watch` process (each build,
//! `program::mark_freeable_parses`; watchfree1). An API source file lease
//! notes its path before its parse (apimem1 fix C,
//! `project::SnapshotHost::acquire_source_file`), so the first version of a
//! leased path gets one. So the first publish, the first version of each
//! file (but a leased one) and every other CLI publish never get a
//! `FileVersion`.
//! `GOPORT_FREE_FILE_VERSIONS=0` turns it off (the behavior before M3a);
//! `=1` turns it on in any process, and then
//! `program::update_program_version` (`goport_multiprog`) applies the same
//! rule to its new parses (the compiler host opens the freeable parse scope
//! for them, M3c). A parse that a parse worker made (prefetch) keeps its
//! nodes in the leaked AST arena; its version still frees its store and
//! `GoFile`. Watch mode parses ahead in its first build and after a config
//! change or an overflow; there a worker parse of a published path owns
//! its nodes (`CompilerHost::freeable_worker_parses`, watchcfg1).
